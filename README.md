# Written with:
	- Xcode:  Version 10.1 (10B61)
	- SWIFT:  Version 4.2


# Designed according to:
	- IphoneXR


# To use this repo: 
	- Download the repository
	- Double click on studydrive.xcodeproj


# How it works:
**Clicking on Producer Button will produce:**
Adding each 3 seconds one new product into the table list as row with the number of the producers (e.g 1° click is the Producer n.1,  2° click is the Producer n.2…).

**Clicking on Customer Button will produce:**
Deleting each 4 seconds one product (one row) from the table list.

**Each button has a counter** to remember how many Producers and Customers are into the “game”. 
I added this counter to understand how many Producers you should have to satisfy the Customers needed in fact, if you add more Customers than existing product, appears a popup to advise to add more Producer to “sell” more products. 

# Extra Features:
**Case management:**
1. Adding Producer Before Customer.
2. Adding Customer Before at least one Producer.
3. Adding more Customers than product. 
	
**Extensions UIViewController:**
1. Creation of extension to manage the UIAlert for ease of use for the cases mentioned above.
2. UIAlert for the management of the cases mentioned above.
 
**Count of users:**
1. Counter for How many producers and customers are on. 

**Documentation:**
1. This readme is a sample of how I believe into the  documentation (and also comments into my code).
2. Repository into Github to share my work.
3. Sample GIF to show how the app works ( https://github.com/Gualberto-Vannini/Producer-Customer/blob/master/sample.gif )


**Developed with passion** (during my weekend).
